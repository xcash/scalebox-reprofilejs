ReProfileJS

ReProfileJS stands for *Re*mote *Profile* *J*ava*S*cript.
It's a very lightweight *framework-independent* (and *framework-enhanced*) javascript library to profile remotely and log the performance of web applications.

Features
========

# Framework independent but framework enhanced
# Mobile compatible
# Logs on console and/or remotely
# JSON data format
# Low priority logging (your applicatin won't be slower with active logging, so you can use it in production to gather profiling information)

Stable Release
